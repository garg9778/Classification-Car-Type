# Classification-of-Cars

This project uses the Car Evaluation Dataset to predict the class of car based on 6 categorical variables. 
We implement various classification algorithms and evaluate performance for each of these algorithms to select a final best performing model.

**Number of Attributes: 6**

**Attribute Values:**

1. buying: v-high, high, med, low
2. maint: v-high, high, med, low
3. doors: 2, 3, 4, 5-more
4. persons: 2, 4, more
5. lug_boot: small, med, big
6. safety: low, med, high
   
**Class Distribution (number of instances per class)**
